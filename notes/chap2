2.1:
types are a type of concept that can hold data, some types are ints and doubles and floats etc. 
floating point #s depend ont he postion of the decimal point. they change according to the decimal point which "floats" or moves around
as processes are made on it.
to use integers double precision floating point #s are used as they are more accurate and act like a calculator and round instead of
having floating point #s
numbers should never have commas in them and if need to should be written as xEy; where x and y are numbers
integeers are better compared to doubles as they are faster and easier to use and run
inegers and doubles are primitive types and are not objects therefore dont have nay methods associated with them.
+ - * / can still be used but that is all

2.2:
variables are a storage place that hold name location and its set data, these allow you to use variables to change them as the program
is running depending on other factors
variables can be used in place of values that they store 
i.e num if defined to 3 can be used for num + num as it means 3 + 3
Strings are used for words
chars for letters
ints for whole numbers
and doubles for any real number
variable names should concisely describe the reason for the variable
strict rules apply when choosing names like reserved words and special character and usage of a number in the first term
method names should use cammel camel case to be written as it is convention likeThis
class names should start with an uppercase letter like This
$symbol is only used for auto generated names and not man made ones

2.3:
the assignment operator = assigns a value to a variable so nums = 5 would set nums to 5
its an error to use a varaoble before it has been assigned and will not compile
assign values to variable before used

2.4:
an object is a value that you can manipulate by calling one or more of its methods
a method is a sequence of insructions telling it wat to do to an object or its variables
for example system.out is an object manipulated by the println method
objects can also let u get data like its length and other parameters it might hold these methods are called getters and are often
very useful
some objects can refer to multiple methods like the println method which can either print a set fata into the console or return the
data as integers, this kinds of a method is called overloaded as it has more than one return type

2.5:
methods are the building blocks of any program as a program only performs if its methods work properly
most methods need inputs that go into the () of the method, for example the println method takes data types as an input to
print onto the console
some might require multiple parameters while other might require no parameters
some methods might return a value like the .lenght() method but some might not return anything back to the user and just do some
calculations for that object
to declare a mthod it needs to know the return type necessary and what parameters it needs to do calclulations
